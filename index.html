# Prototyping the future

- User Research sessions at London All Hands
- Workflows performing particular asks.
- Insights for Shopping:
  - Tab comparison integration
  - Share/save within the browser

## Developing the idea

I have a huge tab management problem.

<img style="width: 70%;" src="./content/tb-desktop.png">

-----
- This resonated with me since I used the Tab Groups feature in Firefox which is now discontinued and moved to a separate addon.
</template>

<template layout="bullets" type="text/x-markdown">
## What I wanted..

A tab organizer that did EVERYTHING!
  - Automatic grouping into arbitrary groups
  - Sync with desktop
  - Custom Tabs for fast page loading on mobile

<template layout="bullets" type="text/x-markdown">
## Developing the idea

- Using Hammock-driven development
  - Identifying the problem we're trying to solve
  - Facts (what do you know about the problem?)
  - Context (relevant background info, e.g. team uses framework X)
  - Constraints (hard requirements)
  - What don't you know?
  - Solutions to similar problems?

-----

With the help of mcomella, we started to look at this from the perspect of Hammock-driven development and ask myself: What is the problem I'm trying to solve?

## Brainstorming

![brain storming](./content/whiteboarding-1.png)

-----

- I spent some time brainstorming and whiteboarding things that weren't so clear.
- E.g. "Switching between tabs is quicker. What exactly is quicker? Why is it..?"

</template>

<template layout="bullets" type="text/x-markdown">

![brain storming](./content/whiteboarding-2.png)

-----

- From these, I narrowed down what I was trying to solve and why I felt it was better.
- I started working on a prototype that did the essentials of what I wanted it to do.

## Tab Groups

<video preload="meta" controls loop height="70%" alt="Tab grouping demo goes here">
    <source src="content/tb-demo.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>

-----

- I built a prototype app that would hold 'tabs' that would use Embedly to scrape keywords from the page and sort the tab into one of the four groups.
- With the help of another intern JD, using supervised learning, I was able to create a model using popular top sites and the keywords retrieved from them to categories the sites into those 4 groups.
- Every new tab would be compared to this model and we could classify the correct tab category from that.
- **show video in the background**
- One of the reasons I felt the original tab grouping helped me being able to identify the page I wanted from the thumbnail alone, so I have the tabs thumbnails as the screenshot of the page itself.
- I kept the categories of the groups hardcoded to these four for simplicity of implementation.

# Mentor for 'good first bug'

- Intended to be trivial for first-time contributors
- Simple tasks with very clear and concise instructions
- Sometimes that doesn't always work out
- You have to figure it out unrelated issues (mostly build things) for them that aren't related to their issue

-----

For me, it was trying to fix the bug myself so that I could see what were the problems they were running into.
</template>

<template layout="bullets" type="text/x-markdown">
## Side Notes

- Write clear instructions to be beginner-friendly, welcoming and clear
- A full set of instructions (!) with little assumption about the person
- First-timers tend to run into problems that you don't think about as being a problem
  - How does mercurial work, pushing to mozreview/try, access control, etc.
- Be helpful!

-----

- When you start writing instructions for a new contributor, you want to make it as welcoming and clear at what needed to be done with a full set of instructions that they needed to fix it.
- You have to remember that we have a ridiculously long development process from a new contributors pov. E.g. explaining how mercurial works, pushing to mozreview, push to try, access control to all the previous tools as well.
- It's incredibly important to be helpful to new contributors - and that's hard when you're trying to solve other problems at the same time.

# What I'm Currently Working On

## Activity Stream

- The activity stream is a rich visual feed of your history and bookmarks.
- It's a new newtab experience for desktop (installed via Test Pilot)
- We want this on mobile as well to get that cross-platform goodness.
- I'm working on implementing the layout and UI for it.
